# Improve Existing Site (in progress)

This restaurant discovery site was provided to me as part of my Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. My assignment was to make the site responsive, make the site accesible, and add a service worker to make the site offline-first. 

_Note: much of this code was provided. To see my changes look at the git log or see the original site [here](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1)_

## Instructions:
To see this site live run a local server from the root directory (e.g. "python -m http.server PORTNUMBER" for python 3+) and go to the port number provided.
